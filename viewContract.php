If you are found by the court to be in unlawful detainer, you will be evicted and found liable for all amounts owed under the lease and/or Utah law, plus attorney fees, court costs, and three times those damages allowed to be trebled under Utah Code Ann. §78B-6-811.

If your lease requires mediation, you must alert us in writing within three days of your willingness to participate in mediation.
